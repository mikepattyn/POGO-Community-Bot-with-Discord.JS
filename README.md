A raiding bot to support my pokemon go community on discord. If it's a success i will continue development and make it accessible for all.

Commands so far are: 

!register (RANK) (FIRSTNAME)(INGAMENAME) (INGAMELVL)

!register levelup

!raid start (TIER) (WORD) ... (TIME)

Possibility to sign up for the raid by using thumbs up emoji as reaction.
Its also possible to add a number emoji from 1-9 to show you are bringing a friend who isn't on discord or even an extra account of your own.
The raid message that was generated by the bot as a result of the command you entered will be updated with your nickname and possible extra.

Soon more info.
